Project Titan - Meeting Notes - August 15, 2025

Attendees: David, Sarah, Mike

Key Discussion Points:
1.  The primary blocker for the Q3 launch is the database scaling issue. Current benchmarks show performance degradation at 10,000 concurrent users, which is below the target of 50,000.
2.  Sarah's team has proposed a new caching layer using Redis, which could alleviate the immediate pressure on the database.
3.  Mike will draft a revised project timeline to account for the implementation of the caching layer. A preliminary estimate suggests a 2-week delay.

Action Items:
-   Mike: Deliver revised timeline by EOD Friday.
-   David: Approve budget for new Redis infrastructure.
